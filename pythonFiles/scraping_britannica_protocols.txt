Protocol, in computer science, a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data 
between electronic devices, such as computers. In order for computers to exchange information, 
there must be a preexisting agreement as to how the information will be structured and how each 
side will send and receive it. Without a protocol, a transmitting computer, for example, 
could be sending its data in 8-bit packets while the receiving computer might expect the data 
in 16-bit packets. Protocols are established by international or industrywide organizations. 
Perhaps the most important computer protocol is OSI (Open Systems Interconnection), 
a set of guidelines for implementing networking communications between computers. 
Among the most important sets of Internet protocols are TCP/IP, HTTPS, SMTP, and DNS.
